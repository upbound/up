# Commands

Commands implemented by `up` are categorized into groups with increasing levels
of specificity. This `up <noun-0>...<noun-N> <verb> [args...]` style caters to
simple discovery and a clearer mapping to REST API endpoints with which the CLI
interacts.

Groups:
- [Top-Level](#top-level)
- [Control Plane](#control-plane)
- [Organization](#organization)
- [Repository](#repository)
- [Robot](#robot)
- [UXP](#uxp)
- [XPKG](#xpkg)
- [XPLS](#xpls)

## Top-Level

Top-level commands do not belong in any subgroup, and are generally used to
configure `up` itself.

Format: `up <cmd> ...`

- `license`
    - Behavior: Prints license information for the `up` binary, which is under
      the [Upbound Software License].
- `login`
    - Flags:
        - `-p,--password = STRING` (Env: `UP_PASS`): Password for specified
          user. If `-` is given the value will be read from stdin.
        - `-t,--token = STRING` (Env: `UP_TOKEN`): Upbound API token used to
          perform the login. If `-` is given the value will be read from stdin.
        - `-u,--username = STRING` (Env: `UP_USER`): User with which to perform
          the login. Email can also be used as username.
        - `--domain = URL` (Env: `UP_DOMAIN`) (Default: `https://upbound.io`):

      only username is provided, the user will be prompted for a password. If
      neither username or password is provided, the user will be prompted for
      both. If token is provided, the user will not be prompted for input. The
      acquired session token will be stored in `~/.up/config.json`. Interactive
      input is disabled if stdin is not an interactive terminal.

    - This command outputs shell commands that you can use to configure
      tab completion in your shell. You can run the output directly, or
      install it in your shell profile (e.g. .bashrc). Once the completion
      commands have been installed, you can use the
      tab key to auto-complete up commands.

      installed Crossplane version to a _compatible UXP version_ (i.e. one that
      has the same major, minor, and patch version). The following scenarios are
      supported when upgrading from Crossplane `vX.Y.Z` installed in the
      `crossplane-system` namespace:
        - `up uxp upgrade vX.Y.Z-up.N -n crossplane-system`: upgrades Crossplane

          Crossplane to an incompatible UXP version in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade -n crossplane-system --force`: upgrades Crossplane to
          an incompatible latest stable version of UXP in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade vX.Y.Z-up.N.rc.xyz -n crossplane-system --unstable`:
          upgrades Crossplane to a compatible unstable version of UXP in the
          same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade vA.B.C-up.N.rc.xyz -n crossplane-system --unstable
          --force`: upgrades Crossplane to a incompatible unstable version of
          UXP in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade -n crossplane-system --unstable --force`: upgrades
          Crossplane to an incompatible latest unstable version of UXP in the
          same namespace.
- `uninstall` 
    - Behavior: Uninstalls UXP from the cluster specified by currently
