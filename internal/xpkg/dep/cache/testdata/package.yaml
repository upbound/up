                      is true, and you do not specify a value for the KMSKeyID parameter,
                      then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key. AWS KMS
                      creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your
                      AWS account has a different default encryption key for each

                      a key policy, it must meet the following criteria: \n    * If
                      you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true, the key
                      policy    must allow the principal that is making the CreateKey
                      request to make    a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the
                      CMK. This reduces the risk that    the CMK becomes unmanageable.
                      For more information, refer to the scenario    in the Default
                      Key Policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam)

                      . \n    * Each statement in the key policy must contain one
                      or more principals.    The principals in the key policy must
                      exist and be visible to AWS KMS.    When you create a new AWS
                      principal (for example, an IAM user or role),    you might need
                      to enforce a delay before including the new principal in    a
                      key policy because the new principal might not be immediately
                      visible    to AWS KMS. For more information, see Changes that
                      I make are not always    immediately visible (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency)

                      If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default
                      key policy to the CMK. For more information, see Default Key

                      Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets
                      you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets
                      you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is
                      rotating certificates. \n The server certificate thumbprint
                      is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate
                      used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its
                      keys available. It is always a 40-character string. \n You must
                      provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider.
                      For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com
                      and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect.
                      In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded
                      SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.
                      \n For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider's

                      As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon
                      DocumentDB distributes the connection requests among the Amazon

                      balance your read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB
                      replicas in your cluster. \n If a failover occurs, and the Amazon

                      be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue
                      sending your read workload to other Amazon DocumentDB replicas
                      in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint."

                      API clients may modify any part of the hostname based on the
                      requirements of the API, (e.g. adding, or removing content in
                      the hostname). Such as, Amazon S3 API client prefixing \"bucketname\"
                      to the hostname, or changing the hostname service name component
                      from \"s3.\" to \"s3-accesspoint.dualstack.\" for the dualstack
                      endpoint of an S3 Accesspoint resource. \n Care should be taken
                      when providing a custom endpoint for an API. If the endpoint
                      hostname is mutable, and the client cannot modify the endpoint
                      correctly, the operation call will most likely fail, or have
                      undefined behavior. \n If hostname is immutable, the SDK API
                      clients will not modify the hostname of the URL. This may cause
                      the API client not to function correctly if the API requires
                      the operation specific hostname values to be used by the client.
                      \n This flag does not modify the API client's behavior if this
                      endpoint will be used instead of Endpoint Discovery, or if the
                      endpoint will be used to perform Endpoint Discovery. That behavior
                      is configured via the API Client's Options. Note that this is

                          that support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod    to sni-only. This
                          is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.    To

                          that don’t    support SNI, set SSLSupportMethod to vip.
                          This is not recommended, and    results in additional monthly

                      in Target. The following is an example. \n '[ \"/bucket2/documentation\",

                      target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
                      S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use
                      the Amazon S3 API to create 0 byte objects as place holders
                      for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api call instead
                      of s3 so you can use the put-object operation. For example,

                      The term \"range attribute\" derives from the way DynamoDB stores
                      items with the same partition key physically close together,
                      in sorted order by the sort key value. \n For a simple primary
                      key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with
                      a KeyType of HASH. \n For a composite primary key (partition
                      key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in
                      this order: The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and
                      the second element must have a KeyType of RANGE. \n For more

                          For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the

                          of DnsName using the AWS CLI command describe-vpc-endpoints
                          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html).
                          \n CloudFront distribution \n Specify the domain name that
                          CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.
                          \n Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate
                          domain name that matches the name of the resource record
                          set. For example, if the name of the resource record set
                          is acme.example.com, your CloudFront distribution must include
                          acme.example.com as one of the alternate domain names. For
                          more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
                          (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)
                          in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. \n You can't create
                          a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route
                          traffic to a CloudFront distribution. \n For failover alias
                          records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for
                          both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must
                          include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
                          the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
                          the same name, and you can't include the same alternate
                          domain name in more than one distribution. \n Elastic Beanstalk
                          environment \n If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk
                          environment includes the region that you deployed the environment
                          in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to
                          the environment. For example, the domain name my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
                          is a regionalized domain name. \n For environments that
                          were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't
                          include the region. To route traffic to these environments,
                          you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record.
                          Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain
                          name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
                          can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com
                          to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create
                          a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic
                          Beanstalk environment. \n For Elastic Beanstalk environments
                          that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute
                          for the environment. You can use the following methods to
                          get the value of the CNAME attribute: \n    * AWS Management

                          to the load balancer based on the health of the target    groups
                          that are associated with the load balancer: For an Application
                          \   or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every
                          target group    that contains targets must contain at least
                          one healthy target. If any    target group contains only
                          unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered    unhealthy,
                          and Route 53 routes queries to other resources. A target
                          group    that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
                          \n When you create a load balancer, you configure settings
                          for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route
                          53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do
                          not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances
                          that you register with an ELB load balancer. \n S3 buckets

                          to true when the alias target is an S3 bucket. \n Other

                          (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another
                          alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check

                      with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record

                      in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported. \n
                      If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping
                      geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for
                      a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
                      goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route
                      most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries
                      for a country on that continent to a different resource. \n

                      by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses
                      aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
                      geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents,
                      Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
                      can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record

                      geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses
                      that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource
                      record set, Route 53 returns a \"no answer\" response for queries
                      from those locations. \n You can't create non-geolocation resource

                      \n When to Specify HealthCheckId \n Specifying a value for HealthCheckId
                      is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more
                      resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want
                      Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health
                      check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following
                      configurations: \n    * Non-alias resource record sets: You're
                      checking the health of a group    of non-alias resource record
                      sets that have the same routing policy, name,    and type (such
                      as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with    a
                      type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource
                      record    sets. If the health check status for a resource record
                      set is healthy,    Route 53 includes the record among the records
                      that it responds to DNS    queries with. If the health check
                      status for a resource record set is    unhealthy, Route 53 stops
                      responding to DNS queries using the value for    that resource
                      record set. If the health check status for all resource    record
                      sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource
                      \   record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries
                      accordingly. \n    * Alias resource record sets: You specify
                      the following settings: You    set EvaluateTargetHealth to true
                      for an alias resource record set in a    group of resource record
                      sets that have the same routing policy, name,    and type (such
                      as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with    a
                      type of A). You configure the alias resource record set to route
                      traffic    to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted
                      zone. You specify    a health check ID for the non-alias resource
                      record set. If the health    check status is healthy, Route
                      53 considers the alias resource record    set to be healthy
                      and includes the alias record among the records that    it responds
                      to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy,
                      \   Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias
                      resource record    set. The alias resource record set can also
                      route traffic to a group of    non-alias resource record sets
                      that have the same routing policy, name,    and type. In that
                      configuration, associate health checks with all of the    resource
                      record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
                      \n Geolocation Routing \n For geolocation resource record sets,
                      if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record
                      set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example,
                      suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
                      States, for the entire United States, for North America, and
                      a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which
                      applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource
                      record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource
                      record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
                      record set for which the endpoint is healthy: \n    * The United
                      States \n    * North America \n    * The default resource record
                      set \n Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name \n
                      If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name,
                      we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
                      endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server
                      that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
                      FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server
                      (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource
                      record sets (www.example.com). \n Health check results will
                      be unpredictable if you do the following: \n    * Create a health
                      check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName    as
                      the name of a resource record set. \n    * Associate that health
                      check with the resource record set."

                      all the healthy records. \n    * If you have more than eight
                      healthy records, Route 53 responds to different    DNS resolvers
                      with different combinations of healthy records. \n    * When
                      all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries

                      Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource
                      record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type.
                      Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's
                      weight to the total. Note the following: \n    * You must specify
                      a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource    record
                      set. \n    * You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted
                      resource record    set. \n    * You can't create latency, failover,
                      or geolocation resource record sets    that have the same values
                      for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource    record
                      sets. \n    * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource
                      record sets that have    the same values for the Name and Type
                      elements. \n    * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource
                      record sets, if you set    Weight to 0 for a resource record
                      set, Route 53 never responds to queries    with the applicable
                      value for that resource record set. However, if you    set Weight
                      to 0 for all resource record sets that have the same combination
                      \   of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources
                      with equal probability.    The effect of setting Weight to 0
                      is different when you associate health    checks with weighted
                      resource record sets. For more information, see Options    for
                      Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover

                      Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following: \n    *
                      CREATING: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon
                      VPC    network interfaces for this endpoint. \n    * OPERATIONAL:
                      The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are    correctly
                      configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries
                      \   between your network and Resolver. \n    * UPDATING: Resolver
                      is associating or disassociating one or more network    interfaces
                      with this endpoint. \n    * AUTO_RECOVERING: Resolver is trying
                      to recover one or more of the network    interfaces that are
                      associated with this endpoint. During the recovery    process,
                      the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the
                      limit    on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network
                      interface). For    the current limit, see Limits on Route 53
                      Resolver (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver).
                      \n    * ACTION_NEEDED: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver
                      can't automatically    recover it. To resolve the problem, we
                      recommend that you check each IP    address that you associated
                      with the endpoint. For each IP address that    isn't available,
                      add another IP address and then delete the IP address    that
                      isn't available. (An endpoint must always include at least two
                      IP    addresses.) A status of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety
                      of causes. Here    are two common causes: One or more of the
                      network interfaces that are    associated with the endpoint
                      were deleted using Amazon VPC. The network    interface couldn't
                      be created for some reason that's outside the control    of
                      Resolver. \n    * DELETING: Resolver is deleting this endpoint
                      and the associated network    interfaces."
